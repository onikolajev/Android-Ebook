/*
   This applet solves the Towers of Hanoi problem for a tower of 10 disks.
   (Ten differently-sized disks are stacked in a pile, in order of
   decreasing size.  There are two other places for piles.  The object
   is to move the pile to the second available place, subject to the
   rules that only one disk at a time can be moved, and no disk can
   be piled on top of a smaller disk.)  The solution is shown as
   an animation.  The Towers of Hanoi problem is a standard example
   of recursion.
   
   The solution is repeated over and over indefinitely.

   The applet MUST have a width of 430 and a height of 143.
