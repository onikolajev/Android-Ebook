 * This panel lets the user place colored rectangles on a canvas

 * by a color palette that lies along the bottom of the applet.
 * Alt-clicking (or clicking with middle mouse button) on a rectangle
 * will delete it.  Shift-clicking a rectangle will move it out in
 * front of all the other rectangles.  The user can right-click-and-drag 
 * to move the rectangles around.  The rectangles are restricted so that 
 * they cannot be moved entirely off the canvas.
 * 
 * The main point of this class is to demonstrate the use of an
 * ArrayList.

 * This class contains a main() routine so that it can be run as
 * a standalone application.  The main routine simply opens a
 * window that uses a SimpleDrawRects panel as its content pane.
 *
